Instructions for Wordle:
Wordle is such a simple game that there are hardly any rules. But here you go:
You have to guess the Wordle in six goes or less
Every word you enter must be in the word list. There are more than 10,000 words in this list, but only 2,309 (at the time of writing) are answers to a specific puzzle
A correct letter in the correct position provides the feedback green
A correct letter in the wrong position provides the feedback yellow
An incorrect letter or letter that is not in the word provides the feedback gray
Letters can be used more than once but you cannot use the same word more than once per game
Answers are never plurals
Each guess must be a valid five-letter word.
The color of a tile will change to show you how close your guess was.

Tips: use words that have different letters to see if they are in the word
